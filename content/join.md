  <h3>Why Join?</h3>
  <p>
Your achievement in scholastic endeavors is recognized and appreciated. Chi Epsilon is no obscure honors society; it is the National Civil Engineering Honor Society. Membership in Chi Epsilon is a mark of excellence readily recognized by friends, family, faculty, and potential employers. You have the opportunity to represent your major, department, and university. Chi Epsilon chapters are encouraged to adopt service projects. Membership affords you a lifelong opportunity to continue social and professional development. The Chi Epsilon publications promote excellence in civil engineering, summarize graduate study opportunities and keep you informed regarding the activities of your fellow members.

  <h3>Qualifications</h3>
  <p>
    The top third of junior- and senior-standing undergraduate civil engineering students at UCLA are eligible to join our society. Ranking is based on a cumulative UCLA-only GPA. Initiation is held in the fall and spring quarters, and eligible candidates who released their contact information to honor societies are notified by e-mail at the beginning of the quarter.  Candidates can accept their offer and begin the quarter-long initiation process. After completing all the requirements, initiates become lifelong Chi Epsilon members.
