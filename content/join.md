        <div class="join-logo"></div>
        <p>The top third of sophomore-, junior-, and senior-standing undergraduate civil engineering students at UCLA are eligible to join our society. Ranking is based on a cumulative UCLA-only GPA. Initiation is held in the fall and spring quarters, and eligible candidates who released their contact information to honor societies are notified by e-mail at the beginning of the quarter.  Candidates can accept their offer and begin the quarter-long initiation process. After completing all the requirements, initiates become lifelong Chi Epsilon members.</p>
