    Chi Epsilon seeks to foster excellence, connectivity and engagement among those in the civil engineering community to improve our world, and we are always happy to help qualified members join us.

  <h3>Qualifications</h3>
  <p>
    The top third of junior- and senior-standing undergraduate civil engineering students at UCLA are eligible to join our society. Ranking is based on a cumulative UCLA-only GPA. Initiation is held in the fall and spring quarters, and eligible candidates who released their contact information to honor societies are notified by e-mail at the beginning of the quarter.  Candidates can accept their offer and begin the quarter-long initiation process. After completing all the requirements, initiates become lifelong Chi Epsilon members.
